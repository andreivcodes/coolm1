## Info

- Made with [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electro) and [ChartJS](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js).

## Functionality

- Detailed temperature graphs for CPU, GPU and ANE

> Note: Last step is necessary because the app is not notarized using an Apple Developer account. Once I will enroll in the Apple Developer program, I will release a notarized version.
